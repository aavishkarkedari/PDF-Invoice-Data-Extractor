# PDF-Invoice-Data-Extractor
This Python project automatically extracts key invoice details from PDF files (both selectable and scanned) and appends them to a structured Excel sheet.  It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for non-selectable PDFs like scanned invoices and supports batch processing of multiple PDFs in a folder.
